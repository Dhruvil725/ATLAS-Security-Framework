## The Problem Everyone Faces

AI governance standards exist. Risk management frameworks exist. 

But there's a **massive gap** between *"assess AI risks"* and *"here's exactly what to implement."*

Security teams are stuck with:
- ‚ùå High-level policies that don't translate to code
- ‚ùå Academic frameworks without practical guidance  
- ‚ùå Vendor solutions that don't map to standards
- ‚ùå No clear path from compliance to implementation

## The Missing Bridge

ATLAS fills that gap with **actionable security controls** that:

‚úÖ **Map directly** to NIST AI RMF, ISO 27001, EU AI Act  
‚úÖ **Include real code examples** you can use today  
‚úÖ **Work in production environments** (battle-tested)  
‚úÖ **Evolve with the community** (open source, collaborative)

*Think of it as the missing implementation manual between AI policy and practice.*

##  The Five Pillars of ATLAS

###  **Trusted Data**
*Ensuring AI learns from clean, verified sources*
- Training data integrity validation
- Privacy-preserving data processing
- Data poisoning detection and prevention

###  **Resilient Models** 
*Building AI that withstands attacks and adversity*
- Adversarial robustness testing
- Prompt injection defense mechanisms
- Model theft and extraction protection

###  **Hardened Operations**
*Deploying AI with enterprise-grade security*
- Secure ML pipeline controls
- API security for AI services  
- Container and infrastructure hardening

###  **Responsible Governance**
*Managing AI risks with clear accountability*
- AI risk assessment methodologies
- Compliance mapping and audit trails
- Ethics and bias monitoring frameworks

###  **Continuous Assurance**
*Monitoring AI behavior in real-time*
- Model drift and performance monitoring
- Anomaly detection in AI outputs
- Security incident response for AI systems

##  Real-World Applications

| Use Case | Primary Threats | ATLAS Solution |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Deepfake Detection | Social engineering, misinformation | Adversarial robustness + data integrity validation |
| Fraud Detection | Model poisoning, adversarial attacks | Trusted data pipelines + continuous monitoring |
| LLM Applications | Prompt injection, data extraction | Input validation + responsible governance |

##  Quick Start

### For Security Practitioners
```bash
# 1. Clone the framework
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvil725/ATLAS-Security-Framework.git

# 2. Validate the included controls
python tools/control-validator.py

# 3.. Browse controls by pillar
cd framework/resilient-models/
cat prompt-injection-defense.yaml

# 4.. Apply to your AI system
# Follow implementation guidance in each control
```

### For Developers
```python
# Example: Implementing data integrity validation
import hashlib
from atlas_controls import DataIntegrityValidator

def validate_training_data(dataset_path):
    validator = DataIntegrityValidator()
    
    # Check file integrity
    if not validator.verify_hash(dataset_path):
        raise SecurityError("Training data integrity compromised")
    
    # Detect statistical anomalies  
    if validator.detect_poisoning(dataset_path):
        alert_security_team("Potential data poisoning detected")
    
    return True
```
