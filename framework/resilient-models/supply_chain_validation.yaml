# RM-004: Pretrained Model & Supply Chain Validation
control_id: "RM-004"
control_name: "Pretrained Model and Supply-Chain Validation"
pillar: "Resilient Models"
status: "draft"

description: >
  Validate third-party models, data, and dependencies before use to prevent
  introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors through the model supply chain.

what:
  - "Verify provenance and signature of pretrained models."
  - "Scan dependent libraries and model artifacts for known vulnerabilities."
  - "Validate model behavior against a safety test suite."

how:
  - "Require signed model artifacts; verify signatures before load."
  - "Run dependency vulnerability scanners on repackaged artifacts."
  - "Execute a small behavior test suite covering edge-cases and sensitive inputs."

code_example: |
  # Example: check model artifact signature (pseudo)
  def verify_model_artifact(artifact_path, trusted_public_key):
      signature = read_signature(artifact_path)
      return verify_signature(artifact_path, signature, trusted_public_key)

compliance_mappings:
  - NIST_AI_RMF: "PROTECT-2.2"
  - ISO_27001: "A.14.1.3"

metrics:
  - "Percent of third-party models validated"
  - "Number of vulnerabilities found in model artifacts"
  - "Time-to-block / quarantine suspect models"
